<title>Getting Started with Bitcoin - We Use Coins</title>
<meta name="description" content="What is Bitcoin? Get started with Bitcoin right. Learn how to buy bitcoins, use the best bitcoin wallets and find the best bitcoin exchanges.">

<h2><b>Step 1</b> ---> Get a Bitcoin wallet</h2>

<p>Setting up your first Bitcoin wallet is simple with several quality mobile apps available.</p>
<p>A great path would be <b>(1)</b> a mobile wallet like Airbitz (iPhone, Android), Breadwallet (iPhone) or Mycelium (Android), <b>(2)</b> acquire bitcoins from a friend, as payment for a good or service or buy bitcoins from Circle and then <b>(3)</b> if you decide to store large amounts of bitcoins and want to know they are absolutely safe then use Armory.</p>
<p><h3>Mobile Bitcoin Wallets</h3>
iPhone and Android apps are available with popular choices including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://airbitz.co">Airbitz</a> (Android, iPhone)</li>
<li><a href="http://breadwallet.com/">Breadwallet</a> (iPhone)</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet">Mycelium</a> (Android)</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>Bitcoin Software Wallets</h3>
Software wallets are downloaded to your computer, give you more control and do not depend on third-party services.  Most software wallets require a day or so to download the blockchain before they are ready for use.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/download">Bitcoin Core</a> - The original wallet from bitcoin.org maintained by the Bitcoin Core development team.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitcoinarmory.com/">Armory</a> - (Highly Recommended) Armory is the most mature, secure and full featured Bitcoin wallet but it can be technologically intimidating for users. Whether you are an individual storing $1,000 or institution storing $1,000,000,000 this is the most secure option available. Users are in complete control all Bitcoin private keys and can setup a secure offline-signing process in Armory.</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>Bitcoin Web Wallets</h3>
Web wallets are the easiest and most convenient to use but are potentially less secure than the above options because the private keys to your bitcoins are held by a third-party.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.circle.com/signup">Circle</a></li>
</ul> 
<p><h3>Bitcoin Hardware Wallets</h3>
Hardware wallets are the most secure because they don't expose your private keys to the network.</p>

<h2><b>Step 2 </b> ---> Get Bitcoins</h2>
<p><h3>Buy Bitcoins</h3>

<p><h3>Earn Bitcoins</h3>
Many people find that the best way to get bitcoins is to accept them as payment for the products or services they already sell.  Just give your customers the option to pay in bitcoin.</p>
<p>To make it easy, you may want to sign up for a bitcoin merchant account which allows you to send invoices and integrate bitcoin payments into your order pages for the most popular online shopping cart systems.</p>
